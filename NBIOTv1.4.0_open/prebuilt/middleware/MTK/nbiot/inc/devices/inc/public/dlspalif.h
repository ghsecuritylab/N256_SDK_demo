 * \ingroup PrdDevicesSpal
 * \ingroup Api
 * Serial Port Abstraction Layer (library) API.
 *
 * The SPAL provides a platform-independent API to serial ports.  It is
 * a thin 'dumb' library only intended to simplify application code and
 * provide portability of serial applications across platforms.
 *
 * It is 'dumb' in the sense that it does not attempt any intelligent policing
 * of the requests made of it.  The code is platform agnostic but
 * programmers using it needs to understand the limitations of the physical
 * hardware they are programming.
 * Attempts to use one device twice <b>will</b> be accepted.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b> "Stacks" and "Ports" </b>
 *
 * The entities above and below the SPAL are termed 'Stack' and 'Port'
 * respectively.
 * <dl>
 * <dt> <b>Stack</b> </dt>
 * <dd> is the 'application' attaching to and using the SPALs virtual
 * port(s). Typically a data stack but doesn't have to be; 'Stack' is just a
 * convenient term to use here.
 * <dt> <b>Port</b> </dt>
 * <dd> is the physical connector (<b>not</b> the UART) and the
 * string of devices (probably including a UART) between the MCU and it.
 * e.g. In the case where one UART may drive one of two physical connectors (via
 * a multiplexer or similar) there are <b>two</b> Ports.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b> Platform independence and 'redundant' parameters </b>
 *
 * This interface definition is the generic superset of platform requirements
 * and thus may include items that are not relevant to the current platform
 * at the current time.
 *
 * For example, the interface allows for DMA to be specified for a platform
 * that does not support it. It is the responsibility of the programmer to
 * avoid such scenarios - not for the interface definition to exclude it.
 * In this way, interface changes are minimised as platforms develop.
