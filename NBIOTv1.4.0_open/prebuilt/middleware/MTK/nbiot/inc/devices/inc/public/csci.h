 *
 * @section CSCI_Architecture_Chapter Software architecture of CSCI
 *    CSCI provides a fixed-size data block exchange service between AP domain and MD domain.
 *    In this context AP domain and MD domain reside in the same SW load (i.e. are executed on the same CPU).
 *    Internally CSCI uses the Queue Management API provided by FreeRTOS.
 *    FreeRTOS supports message exchange across security domains using the Queue Management API.
 *    However, the Queue Management API allows only fixed-size data items per queue.
 *    CSCI supports only one user on the AP domain and one user on the MD domain.
