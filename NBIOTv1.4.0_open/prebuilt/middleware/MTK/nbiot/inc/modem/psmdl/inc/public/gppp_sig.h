 * \ingroup Sig
 * Interface between the Point to Point Protocol (PPP) task and the
 * Application Background (AB) task ABPD module.
 * This section defines the interface between the PPP task and
 * the AB task. This interface is known as GPPP.
 *
 * The PPP task is a slave to the AB task.  ABPD is the main controller
 * of PSD connections and if the connection with the PC is via PPP then
 * ABPD instructs the PPP task at the appropriate times when to start or end
 * negotiations with the peer PPP on the PC.  PPP can also indicate to ABPD
 * if a disconnection via the PPP protocol is received from the peer PPP on the
 * PC.
 * The PPP task provides a mechanism through which PSD functionality
 * can be offered to a terminal that would normally be able to communicate
 * to the Internet with a PPP dial-up link (e.g. a standard Windows PC).
 * PPP is implemented according to RFC 1661 and RFC 1662.
 *
 * The context of GPPP is shown in Figure below:
