 * This signal indicates the size of buffer for MUX to allocate for incoming
 * data from the PC and what data offset to use from the start of that buffer
 * when writing received characters from the serial port. MUX checks that it
 * does not write beyond the end of the allocated buffer when writing received
 * characters.
 *
 * PPP uses an HDLC-like framing structure. MUX knows about the parameters of
 * this frame structure; these are the frame delimiter (flag) character, the
 * escape character and escape mask character. These values enable MUX to detect
 * the start and end of a IP packet, and to re-form characters that have been
 * sent as an escape pair.
 *
 * When the MUX buffer is full (indicated by a closing flag character) MUX sends
 * the data buffer to PPP in a DsPppDataInd.
 *
 * The escapeCharacterMapTx field is a 32-bit character map that defines the
 * characters in a IP packet that must be escaped for transmission. The exception
 * to the discarding is XOFF and XON characters, which MUX recognises as special
 * cases when software flow control is enabled.
 *
 * This signal may be sent at any time, and may redefine any or all of the parameters.
 * There is no response to this signal.
