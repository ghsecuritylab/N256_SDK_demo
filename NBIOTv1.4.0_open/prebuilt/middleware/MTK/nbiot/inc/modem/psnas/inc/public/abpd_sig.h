/** \defgroup SigApexAbpd ABPD Signalling Interface
 * \ingroup NasApex
 * \ingroup Sig
 * This section defines the Application Background Packet Data Procedures.
 * This Application Background procedure is specific to Packet
 * Data.  It communicates with the following tasks:<UL>
 * <LI> ATCI (Client task) via ABPD interface
 * <LI> TCP/IP (Client task) via ABPD interface
 * <LI> MUX (Client task) via ABPD interface
 * <LI> ANRM For read/write of stored PDP Context and EPS bearer
 * information
 * <LI> SM for management of PDP Contexts and EPS Bearers
 * <LI> DBM for management of PDP Context and EPS Bearer data path
 * <LI> PPP for management of the PPP server for PPP connections with
 * the TE. </UL>
 *
 * The following services are provided to the client tasks (ATCI,
 * TCP/IP and MUX) via Apex signals:<UL>
 * <LI> co-ordination of Packet Data Stack access between
 * multiple controlling tasks (allocation of channel numbers and
 * connection IDs)
 * <LI> co-ordination of PDP and EPS bearer context activation,
 * deactivation and modification, by co-ordination of SM and DBM tasks
 * <LI> co-ordination of PPP connection activation and deactivation
 * with the TE for PPP Packet Data connections.
 * <LI> release of Packet Data connection identifiers (deallocation of channel
 * numbers and connection IDs))
 * <LI> reporting of run-time error conditions
 * <LI> transferring PPP configuration signals to the PPP task
 * <LI> transferring PPP loopback control signals to the PPP task
 * <LI> transferring counter signals to/from DBM. </UL>
 *
 * ABPD is the co-ordination point for all Packet Switched connections
 *(ie PDP contexts for 2G/3G and EPS bearers for LTE).
 *
 * The context of the ABPD interface is illustrated in the Figure 1 below:
