 * Interface between SIM manager and layer 3 Mobility Manager (MM).
 * This section defines the interface between GSM/3G/LTE Mobility Manager
 * (MM) and the USIM manager. This interface is known as SIM.
 *
 * The SIM interface allows MM to write data to, read data from, and
 * delete data within, the SIM/UICC, and also to request the SIM/UICC
 * to perform authentication procedures. The USIM manager sends back
 * the results of these requests to MM. This interface is for data only.
 *
 * The signals used for this interface are based on the requirements of
 * MM to read, write, and delete SIM/UICC data, and to activate authentication
 * procedures within the SIM/UICC.
 *
 * The context of the SIM interface is illustrated in the following diagram.
