 * This document covers the rules that Foreground Layer tasks follow when 
 * they wish to make use of Background Layer, single-user procedures.
 * This section describes the way in which multiple Foreground Layer tasks 
 * manage the control of the Background Layer. The Background Layer has the 
 * concept of a Controlling Task, however existing Foreground Tasks do not 
 * make use of this in a co-operative manner. For instance they make assumptions
 * about whether they have control and they refuse to relinquish control when they 
 * could otherwise do so. 
 *
 * This section looks at single-user procedures and describes when the associated 
 * Foreground Layer tasks should take control and when they should relinquish it.
