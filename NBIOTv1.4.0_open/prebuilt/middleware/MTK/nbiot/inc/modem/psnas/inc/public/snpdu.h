/**** XID Block ****

This is an array of bytes (Int8) containing Layer 3 configuration data in the
following format:

<parameter>[<parameter>...<parameter>]

where:

<parameter> = <xid parameter type>[<xid parameter length>]<parameter values>

if <xid parameter type> is 0, then <xid parameter length> is omitted.

if <xid parameter type> = 1 or 2, then <parameter values> = <algorithm type>
   <unacked NSAPI bitmap><acked NSAPI bitmap><algorithm params length>
   <algorithm params>

Parameter block component sizes: component size in bytes

<xid parameter type> : 1

<xid parameter length> : 1

<algorithm type> : 1

<unacked NSAPI bitmap> : 2

<algorithm params length> : 1

<algorithm params> : variable

Note that there is no length field associated with the SNDCP version number,
as this is always a fixed length of 1 octet.

This block is created from internal SNDCP data as context activations are
created and destroyed.

The response to a 'requesting' XID block is a  `negotiated' XID block
containing the requested values or alternative suggested values for header
compressions and data compressions.
