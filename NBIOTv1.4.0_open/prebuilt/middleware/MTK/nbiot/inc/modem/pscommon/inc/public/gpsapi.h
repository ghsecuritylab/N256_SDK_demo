 * SAPIs are used at the SNDCP-LLC interface. A SAPI is associated with a
 * quality of service. For acknowledged data transfer, the SAPI is negotiated
 * with the network. For unacknowledged data transfer, the SAPI is chosen by SM
 * locally. GSM 04.64 states that "ABM operation for SAPIs 1 and 7 is not
 * permitted". This has no impact on SNDCP, which uses only SAPI values 3, 5, 9
 * and 11.
