/*
The (private) LLC variables embedded in LlcDataReq and LlcDataInd signals.

The next field:
A pointer to the next frame in the LLC transmit/receive window
implemented as single linked list of signals.
This field must be the very first field of the signal!

The state field:
State of the frame in transmit/receive window.

The ns field (Send sequence number):
At the time that an in-sequence I frame is designated for transmission,
the value of N(S) is set equal to the value of the send state variable V(S).

The tsn field  (transmission sequence number):
Each LLC stores the history of the transmitted I frames, i.e., the LLE will
remember the I-frame transmission sequence. The history is used to decide
which I frames to retransmit. Due to retransmission, the history is not
necessarily an in-order sequence.
The tsn is updated with a new highest number on each (re-)transmission.
An unacknowledged I frame that was (re-)transmitted prior to an acknowledged
I frame (ie tsn1 < tsn2) will be considered lost and marked for retransmission.

The rc field (retransmission count variable):
The LLE maintains an internal retransmission count variable
for each transmitted I frame.
The LLE increments by 1 the RC of retransmitted I frame
- associated with T201 on timer T201 expiry (but not on peer receiver busy)
- on receipt of acknowledgement (after analysing transmission sequence history)
