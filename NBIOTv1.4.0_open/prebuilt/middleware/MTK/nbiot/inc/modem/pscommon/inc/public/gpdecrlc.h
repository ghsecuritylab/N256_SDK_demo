 *  FUNCTION PROTOTYPES
 *
 *  General notes on parameters:
 *
 *  In:     *rawMsg_p:  pointer to first octet of the control message content
 *                      of an rlc/mac downlink message.  The message may have
 *                      been received in either one, or in some cases two,
 *                      downlink rlc/mac control blocks, as defined in
 *                      04.60 v8.0.0 10.3.1.  Where the message was split over
 *                      2 rlc/mac control blocks, the 'control message
 *                      content' of the two are assumed to have been
 *                      concatenated into a single contiguous block of memory.
 *                      The message type (04.60 11.2.0.1) is therefore located
 *                      in the 6 most significant bits of *rawMsg_p, and the
 *                      remaining message content, as defined in CSN.1 in
 *                      04.60 11.2, follows on contiguously.
 *
 * In:      msgLen:     length of the message to be decoded, in octets.  Where
 *                      the message was split over 2 rlc/mac control blocks
 *                      this is in the range 40-44(??).  Where the message
 *                      occupies a single rlc/mac control block
 *                      this is in the range 20-22.  (The decode utilities
 *                      need this in order to check that the message is
 *                      correctly padded, and also to guard against 'run-off'
 *                      when decoding structures which repeat indefinitely.
 *                      In some cases where two separate functions are used
 *                      to decode the complete message, this parameter is
 *                      omitted for the first function.)
 *
 * In or Out: *bitOffset_p:     offset (in bits) from *rawMsg_p at which
 *                      decoding is to start.  This parameter is only
 *                      relevant where two separate functions are used
 *                      to decode the complete message: it is output by
 *                      the first function to indicate where decoding
 *                      stopped, and must be preserved by the calling task
 *                      and input to the second function.
 *
 * Out or i/o: xxxx_p:  pointer to the appropriate a data structure of the
 *                      appropriate type for the message being decoded.  This
 *                      is normally listed as an output parameter.  In some
 *                      cases it is identified in the function header as an
 *                      i/o parameter: this implies that the calling task
 *                      is expected to supply default values for
 *                      optional fields within this data structure.  These
 *                      will be returned unchanged to the caller in the
 *                      event that the field is absent.  (This mechanism may
 *                      be used in some cases to avoid the need for an
 *                      explicit 'field present' flag.)
