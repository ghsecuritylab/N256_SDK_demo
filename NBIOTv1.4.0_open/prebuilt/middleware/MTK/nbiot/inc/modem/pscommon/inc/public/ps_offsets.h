/** \file
 * Definitions for TMM buffer offsets used in the protocol stack.
 * The offsets make it possible to reuse the same buffer without having to
 * reallocate it as it passes through the stack.
 * The offsets cover the worst case scenarios (maximum number of bytes that
 * may need to be reserved by a particular task in different scenarios).
 * It is the responsibility of the protocol stack layer that allocates the
 * TMM buffer to make sure enough space is reserved in the header and tail
 * when it passes data to the next layer.
 *
 * The following illustrations help clarify the requirements for the offsets:
 *
 * 27.010 MUX frame format (Basic Option):
 * \code
 * +----+----+----+----+----------------------------------------+-----+----+
 * |Flag|Addr|Ctrl|Len |            Information                 | FCS |Flag|
 * | (1)| (1)| (1)| (2)|                                        | (1) | (1)|
 * +----+----+----+----+----------------------------------------+-----+----+
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that the 27.010 MUX offset requirements are multiplied by 2, in order
 * to support stacked 27.010 MUX to the PC (one between the modem and the
 * apps processor, and one between the PC and the modem running over the
 * first).
 *
 * PPP frame format:
 * \code
 * +----+----+----+--------+------------------------------------+-----+----+
 * |Flag|Addr|Ctrl|Protocol|            Information             | FCS |Flag|
 * | (1)| (1)| (1)|   (2)  |                                    | (2) | (1)|
 * +----+----+----+--------+------------------------------------+-----+----+
 * \endcode
