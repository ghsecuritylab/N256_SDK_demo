 * \ingroup Layer13G
 * \ingroup Sig
 *
 * This section defines all the primitives exchanged on the control plane of
 * RRC and 3G L1, hereinafter called the CPHY interface.
 *
 * The CPHY interface is illustrated in the figure below:
 *
 * \image html prd3gdualmodeinterface.png "Fig: Dual Mode Architecture"
 * \image latex prd3gdualmodeinterface.eps "Dual Mode Architecture" width=12cm
 *
 * All the primitives have been categorised based on the common purpose for
 * which they are exchanged. For example, all the primitives exchanged during
 * initial cell selection and reselection are put into <tt>Cell Selection and
 * Re-selection Primitives</tt> category.
 *
 * \section SigCphyParDesc Common Parameter Description
 * <B>Common Parameter Description</B>
 *
 * Many of the configuration primitives (Req and Cnf) include the following
 * parameters:
 *
 * <TABLE>
 * <TR><TD><B>Parameter Type</B></TD>    <TD><B>Name               </B></TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>configIdentifier          </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>configNoOfMessages        </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>configMessageNo           </TD></TR>
 * </TABLE>
 *
 * These are used to group configuration primitives together so that the
 * physical layer knows how many messages to expect for a configuration event.
 * The \c configIdentifier is allocated by RRC and has the same value for all
 * primitives that need to be processed by the physical layer at the same time.
 * The \c configNoOfMessages tells the physical layer how many primitives there
 * are in total in this group of primitives. The \c configMessageNo identifies
 * an individual primitive in this group and is in the range 1 to \c
 * configNoOfMessages.
 *
 * When these parameters are used in Req primitives the physical layer is
 * expected to send only one #CphyCcTrChConfigCnf primitive to confirm the whole
 * group of Req primitives. This is to reduce the signalling bandwidth on the
 * CPHY interface.
 *
 * <B> CcTrch Index </B>
 *
 * A number of primitives use a CcTrCh index to identify the mapping of transport
 * channels to physical channels., plus   The following index values are used:
 *
 * <TABLE>
 * <TR><TD><B>#DEFINE              </B></TD>    <TD><B>VALUE         </B></TD></TR>

 * The Option 1 and 2 for IDLE mode is required because it is possible to have the CBS service
 * mapped to a CTCH, which is either on the same SCCPCH as the PCH or on a separate SCCPCH.

 * <B> Physical Layer State Transitions </B>

 * A typical physical layer state transition diagram is illustrated as below:

 * physical layer there are a number of implicit actions as defined below:

 * Both the serving cell BCH decode and neighbour cell BCH decode are never
 * simultaneously requested by RRC to L1.
 *
 * RRC will take into consideration the minimum skip time defined by
 * #UPS_MINIMUM_SKIP_FRAMES when issuing #CphyBchSkipReq and
 * #CphyNcellBchSkipReq primitives to L1. This is because, since BCH is
 * SFN modulo 2 and assuming L1 takes roughly a frame to decode the BCH data
 * and indicate it using #PhyDataInd primitive, it is fairly safe to assume that
 * RRC would not issue #CphyBchSkipReq and #CphyNcellBchSkipReq primitives for
 * a skip time less than what is defined by #UPS_MINIMUM_SKIP_FRAMES.
 *
 * \section SigCphyCellSelReselImpAct Implicit Actions
 * During cell selection process, the following implicit actions should be
 * executed in the physical layer upon the receipt of #CphyCellSelectReq,
 * #CphyFindCellReq or #CphyNextCellReq primitives:
 *     - serving cell measurements stopped
 *     - neighbour cell measurements stopped
 *     - neighbour cell decode stopped
 *     - serving cell decode started

 * Monitored cells are cells that the physical layer knows about from the

 * primitives. Measurements for monitor cells are requested using the

 * that the physical layer detects autonomously. \note The physical layer
 * is only required to monitor detected cells when it receives a
 * #CphyDetectedCellMeasurementReq primitive from the protocol stack.
 *
 * UE Internal measurements for transmit power and RX to TX time differences
 * are requested using the #CphyUeInternalMeasurementReq primitive.
 *
 * The measurement model for the system is as defined in <tt>[3G TS 25.302]</tt>
 * with only layer 3 filtering and evaluation being performed in the protocol stack.
 * The physical layer is responsible for all other averaging and filtering
 * that is necessary to achieve the performance criteria defined in <tt>
 * [3G TS 25.133]</tt>.
 *
 * The Intra-Frequency CPICH measurement period in CELL_DCH state is defined in
 * <tt>[3G TS 25.133 section 8]</tt> as 50 ms. However, <tt>[3G TS 25.302]</tt>
 * does not define the rate of measurements between the physical layer and
 * protocol stack. Therefore, the protocol stack can be configured to accept
 * intra-frequency measurements every 10, 20, 40, 50 or 100 ms to suit different
 * physical layer implementations. Also it is possible to spread the cells
 * measured over a number of different measurement reports.
 *
 * This is best explained by the following example:
 *
 * If a physical layer solution can report up to 2 measurements every 10ms and
 * can report all visible cells (A, B, C, D, E, F and G in this example) within
 * 50ms the report would be as follows:

 * </TABLE>
 *
 * The measurement period is configured using UPS_INTRA_FREQ_FILTER_COUNT
 * in uphy_cfg.h. This defines the number of measurements the physical layer
 * will send every 200 ms. For the above example this is set to 4 (i.e. one
 * measurement every 50 ms).
 *
 * The protocol stack needs to know which cells the physical layer is measuring
 * and so the physical layer must send a #CphyMeasureIntraFreqCellsInd
 * primitive whenever the measured cell list changes. Therefore, a #CphyMeasureIntraFreqCellsInd
 * must be sent following every #CphyMonitorInterFreqCellReq primitive.
 *
 * \note #CphyMeasureIntraFreqCellsInd primitive is only used in CELL_DCH
 * state.
 *
 * If a cell is replaced by another cell then the PHY must send
 * #CphyMeasureIntraFreqCellsInd primitive indicating that the old cell is no
 * longer measured. As soon as the PHY detects that it can measure the new
 * cell it must send another #CphyMeasureIntraFreqCellsInd primitive indicating
 * that the new cell is being measured.
 *
 * The physical layer may indicate that a cell is currently not found (i.e. it
 * is not being actively monitored) by returning minimum values for Ec/N0 and
 * RSCP of -32768.
 *
 * Ec/No and RSCP are always reported in 1/8 dB and 1/8 dBm steps respectively.
 * \section example example
 * For example:
 * for RSCP -80 = -10 dBm;
 * for Ec/No -24 = -3 dB
 *
 * For Inter-Frequency measurements the measurement period is typically 480ms
 * but this can be longer if the compressed gaps are not sufficient to make
 * all the required measurements.  The #CphyMeasureInterFreqCellsInd
 * primitive is used to let the protocol stack know which inter-frequency
 * cells are being measured in the same ways as they are indicated for
 * intra-frequency measurements. The physical layer can send one report for all
 * cells being measured or can split the cells reported across more than one
 * #CphyMonitorInterFreqCellInd primitives. The protocol stack will filter
 * the measurements when they arrive but will only evaluate events once it has
 * received a measurement report for all the cells being measured.
 *
 * There is a requirement in <tt>[3G TS 25.331]</tt> and <tt>[3G TS 25.133]</tt>
 * to report measurement results on RACH, which could require the physical layer
 * to make measurement in all states except CELL_DCH for subsequent reporting
 * on RACH. This requires the physical layer to determine the maximum neighbour
 * cells (the protocol stack will inform the physical layer of the number of
 * cells to be reported and this can be 0 to 6). The measurements are requested
 * using the #CphyIntraFreqMeasOnRachReq primitive.
 *
 * During GSM PLMN search, the following applies:
 *     - Immediately after sending a #CphyGsmListMeasInd to RRC, PHY starts
 *       to scan the Strong Cells List and attempts to do BSIC decoding for the
 *       next strongest ARFCN for which synchronisation is successful.
 *     - Once PHY has decoded the BSIC (see above) for an ARFCN and has sent a
 *       #CphyGsmListBsicInd to RRC, PHY retrieves system information
 *       message type 3 and 4 and passes them on to RRC in separate
 *       #CphyGsmBcchDecodeInd (s). PHY then listens for
 *       #CphyGsmListBcchReq (s) until either a #CphyGsmListNextReq or a
 *       #CphyGsmListStopReq is received.
