/** \defgroup SigUphy UPHY Signalling Interface
 * \ingroup Layer13G
 * \ingroup Sig
 *
 * This section defines all the primitives exchanged on the data plane of MAC
 * and 3G L1, hereinafter called the UPHY interface, to enable transmission and
 * reception of data and for synchronisation on the uplink and the downlink.
 *
 * The UPHY interface is illustrated in the figure below:
 *
 * \image html prd3gdualmodeinterface.png "Fig: Dual Mode Architecture"
 * \image latex prd3gdualmodeinterface.eps "Dual Mode Architecture" width=12cm
 *
 * All the primitive definitions are based on the recommendations defined in
 * <tt>[3G TS 25.302 section 10]</tt> with additions to fill any areas not
 * covered by these recommendations.
 *
 * The timing of the primitives in downlink and uplink is as explained below.
 *
 * <B> Timing in Downlink </B>
 *
 * The following figure illustrates how the #PhyDataInd reports the actual
 * frame number of when the BCCH data was received.
 *
 * \image html prd3gdownlinktiming.png "Fig: Timing of downlink primitives"
 * \image latex prd3gdownlinktiming.eps "Timing of downlink primitives" width=12cm
 *
 * The position of the #PhyDataInd relative to the received data will be
 * physical layer dependent.
 *
 * The timing in dedicated mode is exactly the same except that frame numbers
 * are reported using the CFN.
 *
 * <B> Timing in Uplink </B>
 *
 * The following figure illustrates the timing relationship for data
 * transmission.
 *
 * \image html prd3guplinktiming.png "Fig: Timing of uplink primitives"
 * \image latex prd3guplinktiming.eps "Timing of uplink primitives" width=12cm
 *
 * The timing of the #PhyFrameInd is such that the protocol stack can respond
 * with the #PhyDataReq before the end of the current frame. The above indicates
 * a typical physical layer solution where the data is encoded in the next
 * frame and transmitted in the following frame. The frame delay from receipt
 * of the #PhyDataReq and transmitting the data will be physical layer
 * dependent. The protocol stack must know the actual delay, as the MAC needs
 * to know the transmission frame number for ciphering. In the above example
 * the MAC ciphers the above data with CFN=3.
