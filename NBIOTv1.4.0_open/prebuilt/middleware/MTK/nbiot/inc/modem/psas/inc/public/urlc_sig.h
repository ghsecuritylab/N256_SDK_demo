 * This section defines the signal interface between the Radio Link
 * Control (URLC) task and the higher layers for Mediatek's 3GPP Protocol Stack.
 * This interface is referred to as the URLC interface. The document describes
 * the signals sent between these entities in terms of data structures and data values,
 * and provides a summary of the purpose of each signal, when it may be expected to occur,
 * and how it relates to other signals on the same interface.
 *
 * <B> The context of the URLC interface is illustrated in the following diagram.</B>
 * \subsection PSInterfaceFigure Figure
 * \image html URLC_Interface.png
 *
 * The URLC interface is responsible for the transfer of user data between the URLC and the
 * higher layer entities (URRC, UPDCP, UBMC and the Circuit Switched Data Interface (CSDI)).
 *
 *
 * The signal definitions are based on the recommendations defined in Reference [3G TS 25.322]
 * with additions to fill any areas not covered by these recommendations.
