 * Signalling interface between (G)MM and (G)RR tasks.
 * This section defines all the primitives exchanged between
 * (G)MM and (G)RR, hereinafter called the GRR interface.
 *
 * GRR is a combined GSM/GPRS/EGPRS module that controls Layer 1, communicates with
 * the network via RLC-MAC and provides information to the higher layers.
 * In addition to handling circuit switched idle mode and dedicated mode operation
 * in the normal way, RR/GRR provides the following GPRS features:<UL>
 * <LI> initial network access (RACH/PRACH)
 * <LI> measurement acquisition and reporting
 * <LI> neighbour cell BSIC decode requests
 * <LI> cell selection/reselection
 * <LI> monitoring of system information
 * <LI> paging reception.
 * </UL>
 *
 * The context of  GRR signalling interface is shown in the Diagram below.
