 * \ingroup Prd3gDmProtoStack
 * \ingroup Sig
 *
 * This section defines all the primitives exchanged on the control plane of
 * RRC and MAC, hereinafter called the CMAC interface.
 * CMAC interface is the interface between MAC and RRC as shown in this
 * see \ref PSInterfaceFigure
 *
 * All the primitives have been categorised based on the common purpose for
 * which they are exchanged. For example, all the Signals used for configuration
 * of Common Channels are put into <I>Signals used for configuration
 * of Common Channels</I> category.
 *
 * \subsection SigCmacParDesc Common Parameter Description
 * <B>Common Parameter Description</B>
 *
 * Many of the configuration primitives (Req and Cnf) include the following
 * parameters:
 *
 * <TABLE>
 * <TR><TD><B>Parameter Type</B></TD>    <TD><B>Name               </B></TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>configIdentifier          </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>configNoOfMessages        </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>configMessageNo           </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Boolean              </TD>    <TD>waitForActivationTime      </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>Int8                 </TD>    <TD>activationTimeIndex        </TD></TR>
 * </TABLE>
 *
 * These are used to group configuration primitives together so that the
 * MAC knows how many messages to expect for a configuration event.
 * The \I configIdentifier is allocated by RRC and has the same value for all
 * primitives that need to be processed by the physical layer at the same time.
 * The \I configNoOfMessages tells the physical layer how many primitives there
 * are in total in this group of primitives.
 * The \I configMessageNo identifies an individual primitive in this group and
 * is in the range 1 to \I configNoOfMessages.
 * The \I waitForActivationTime indicates whether MAC should activate a configuration
 * immediately (\I waitForActivationTime = \I FALSE) or wait for L1 to indicate
 * activation of a pending configuration (\I waitForActivationTime = \I TRUE).
 * The \I activationTimeIndex is ued to check whether the correct pending
 * configuration has been activated.
