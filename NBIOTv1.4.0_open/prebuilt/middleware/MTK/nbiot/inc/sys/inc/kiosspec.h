/** \page GkiOsAbsInfo1 GKI OS Abstraction.
 * \section TaskEntryPoint Task Entry Point Definition
 * The GKI defines a Task entry point as being
 *
 * \code
 *     KI_ENTRY_POINT MyTask (KI_TASK_ARGS)
 * \endcode
 *
 * This maps to being
 *
 * \code
 *     void MyTask (void)
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the underlying OS requires a different task entry point definition then
 * one or more of the #KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT, #KI_OS_TASK_ARGS and
 * #M_KiOsEntryPointReturn() configuration items may need to be defined by
 * the OS specific file included in kiosspec.h.
 *
 * If either #KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT or #KI_OS_TASK_ARGS is defined then the GKI
 * will create wrapper functions that match the OS task entry point
 * requirements. Pointer to these entry points will be stored in the
 * kiOsEntryPointWrappers[] array. These need to be used in the OS
 * specific implementation of #M_KiOsCreateTask() instead of the GKI
 * compliant entry point stored in kiTaskInitTable[].entryPoint (the index
 * to both arrays is the same).
 *
 * If wrapper functions are needed it will end up using a bit more stack per
 * task and some extra ROM space. In most cases wrapper functions should not
 * be needed even when the OS requires arguments or a return value. Any
 * arguments would be ignored by the GKI entry point and GKI tasks normally
 * don't return.
 *
 * Some examples assuming the OS does require a different entry point
 * definition:
 *
 * Example 1: OS requires - int EntryPoint (void)
 *
 * \code
 *     #define KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT         int
 *     #define M_KiOsEntryPointReturn()  return (0)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Example 2: OS requires - void EntryPoint (int param1, int param2)
 *
 * \code
 *     #define KI_OS_TASK_ARGS           int param1, int param2
 *     #define M_KiOsEntryPointReturn() \
 *             {                        \
 *                 PARAMETER_NOT_USED(param1); \
 *                 PARAMETER_NOT_USED(param2); \
 *             }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Example 3: OS requires - int EntryPoint (int param1, int param2)
 *
 * \code
 *     #define KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT         int
 *     #define KI_OS_TASK_ARGS           int param1, int param2
 *     #define M_KiOsEntryPointReturn() \
 *             {                        \
 *                 PARAMETER_NOT_USED(param1); \
 *                 PARAMETER_NOT_USED(param2); \
 *                 return (0);          \
 *             }
 * \endcode
 *
 * But as detailed above even if the OS normally requires one of these forms
 * you can often get away without configuring these items. */

/** \def KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT
 * OS required entry point type.
 * This is used to define the type that a task entry point needs to be for the
 * underlying OS e.g.
 *
 * KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT MyTask (KI_OS_TASK_ARGS).
 *
 * If this is defined then the GKI will create wrapper functions
 * (kiOsEntryPointWrappers[]) for all the entry points that should then be
 * used instead of the entry points given in kiTaskInitTable[].entryPoint.
 * The #M_KiOsEntryPointReturn() macro will also need to be defined if it is
 * a non-void return type. */

/** \def KI_OS_TASK_ARGS
 * OS required entry point arguments.
 * This is used to define the arguments that a task entry point needs to have
 * for the underlying OS e.g.
 *
 * KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT MyTask (KI_OS_TASK_ARGS).
 *
 * If this is defined then the GKI will create wrapper functions
 * (kiOsEntryPointWrappers[]) for all the entry points that should then be
 * used instead of the entry points given in kiTaskInitTable[].entryPoint.
 * The #M_KiOsEntryPointReturn() macro may also need to be defined to
 * call PARAMETER_NOT_USED() to prevent warnings for the unused arguments. */

/** \def M_KiOsEntryPointReturn()
 * Macro called at the end of a GKI task wrapper to clean up.
 * This macro adds code at the end of any GKI OS entry point wrappers. This
 * should include any call to return if needed due to #KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT
 * not being void. This may also need to call PARAMETER_NOT_USED() for any
 * unused parameters introduced from #KI_OS_TASK_ARGS. */

/** \def KI_OS_TASK_WRAPPERS_REQUIRED
 * Internal conditional indicating task wrappers are required.
 * This conditional compile is automatically enabled if the OS specific file
 * included in #kiosspec.h defines either #KI_OS_ENTRY_POINT or
 * #KI_OS_TASK_ARGS (or both). This should not be enabled manually in the build.
 * This is used internally to enable generation of the OS specific task entry
 * point wrapper functions. */
