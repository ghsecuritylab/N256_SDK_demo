/** \file
 * This file includes all the signal definition include files for each set
 * (*siginc.h). This file is then included into both the Signal union
 * (in KISIGUNI.H) and the #SignalId enumeration (in PSSIGNAL.H).
 *
 * There is no multiple inclusion protection as this file can be included
 * more than once in the same file.
 *
 * If you add a new include into this file you may also need to add an
 * include into KISIGUNI.H that defines the signal structures. Building a
 * signal database (that includes the new signals) in a PC test tool
 * (e.g. Genie, use Signal Maker to check signals appear with the correct
 * structures) will check that signal definitions have been correctly
 * added to the system. */
