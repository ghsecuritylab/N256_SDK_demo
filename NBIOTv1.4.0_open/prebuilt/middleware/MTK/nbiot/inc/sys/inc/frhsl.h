 * \brief This is the low-level drivers header file for the FrHsl module.
 * This file contains register definitions and access macros which define
 * an API to the HSL device in the ABP.  The logging routines and functions used
 * by software on the same processor as the HSL, and by software on another
 * processor (via the client/server parts of the module) are built on these
 * low-level routines.
 *
 * The ABP HSL module is documented for ABPv3 in
 * csiabp_3131.doc/.pdf.
 * \see frhslcfg.h for logging routines on the same processor.
 * \see frhslc.h for the client interface.
 * \see frhsls.h for the server interface.
