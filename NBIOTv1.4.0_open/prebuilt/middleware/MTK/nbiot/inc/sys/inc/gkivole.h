 * \ingroup PrdGki
 * \ingroup Api
 * Watchvole API.
 * The watchvole is a simple software counter that is used to ensure that all
 * tasks in the system are able to run in some amount of time.  The mechanism
 * is typically used to control a hardware watchdog and operates according
 * to the following rules:
 *
 *  - Whenever the lowest priority task runs, the watchvole count is reset by
 *     calling KiWatchVoleReset().
 *  - Each tick to the system increments the watchvole count by calling
 *     KiWatchVoleUpdate().
 *  - If the watchvole count is below some threshold, each tick to the system
 *     also resets the watchdog.  This is determined from the result returned
 *     by KiWatchVoleUpdate().
 *
 * This means that the watchdog will be prevented from resetting the system
 * so long as the periodic system tick is running, and that the lowest
 * priority task is able to run and reset the watchvole count before it
 * expires.
 *
 * \note A vole is a rodent that resembles a rat or mouse but with shorter
 *       limbs and tail as well as a heavier body.  While unable to cause
 *       much harm to a dog, a vole would be able to keep one awake.
