 * this function will assert. If asserts are not being checked it will block
 * the calling task and wait for memory to become available. This is a

 * caller wants to handle out of memory conditions itself use either
 * #KiAllocPollMemory() or #KiRequestMemory(). The contents of the
 * allocated memory is undefined, use #KiAllocZeroMemory if you need the
 * memory cleared.
 *
 * \note Passing a size of zero for the allocation will cause this function
 *           to allocate a block with zero user bytes but a valid pointer.
 *           It is unclear why this was done but it has not been changed
