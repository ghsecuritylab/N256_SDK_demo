/** GKI boot/reset/initialisation function.

 * the GKI objects (tasks, queues, memory, semaphores). Typically an RTOS
 * has a state during startup where it allows RTOS objects to be created
 * but where scheduling is disabled, this is where this function should be
 * called. If the RTOS has no such state then some extra options may need
 * to be enabled. If KiReset() is called while shceduling is active the
 * #KI_CREATE_ALL_QUEUES_BEFORE_TASKS conditional may be needed to make
 * sure all GKI queues exist before tasks are created. Otherwise a task
 * may attempt to signal a non-existing queue. If the creation of queues
 * cannot be split from the task creation then another solution is to
 * disable scheduling around the call to KiReset or to call it from the
 * highest priority task in the system (may also have to disable
 * interrupts to prevent them sending any signals). */
