/** \defgroup ApiGkiTimer GKI Timer API
 * \ingroup Api
 * The functional interface for timer services provided by the GKI.
 * The GKI timer API provides functions for creating single-shot delays in the
 * range of 5ms through to hours and days.  Timers are started and manipulated
 * using this functional interface, and expired timers are indicated to tasks
 * by the reception of a #KiTimerExpiry signal allowing tasks to block on
 * #KiRecieveSignal until the timer has expired.
 *
 * The timer task is also involved in power saving activities, and the use of
 * coarse timers, whose expiry may occur at any point in a range of timer, is
 * encouraged for timers that maybe active in states when slow clocking may
 * be desired.
 *
 * The GKI Timer task measures time in #KernelTicks, which may have a varying
 * relation to real time depending on the exact configuration of the system.
 * Therefore a number of macros are provided to convert between absolute time
 * measures and #KernelTicks.
 *
 *   - #MILLISECONDS_TO_TICKS and #TICKS_TO_MILLISECONDS
 *   - #KI_GSM_FRAME_TO_KERNEL_TICKS and #KI_KERNEL_TO_GSM_FRAME_TICKS
 *
 * Some of the function for starting a timer can accept a signal id parameter
 * that sets the id of the timer expiry signal. This signal must be defined to
 * have a body of type #KiTimerExpiry, for example:
 *
 * \code
 * SIG_DEF(SIG_XYZ_TIMER_EXPIRY, KiTimerExpiry xyzTimerExpiry)
 * \endcode

/** Start a Timer to expire in a window described by fixed offsets.
 * This function will start a timer that will expire within some defined
 * window.  For timers operating in modes where power saving is possible
 * by powering down the MCU, the window is used by the timer task to relax
 * the requirements for the MCU to be awake such that most timers expire
 * while the system is awake due to other activities.
 *
 * A timer is always guaranteed to expire at some time described by the
 * following:
 *
 * \code
 *   E <= expiryTime <= L;
 * \endcode
 *
 * The parameter \a E describes the minimum number of #KernelTicks that must
 * pass before the timer may expire, and generally a timer will expire as soon
 * as this count has been reached unless the MCU is asleep, in which case the
 * timer will expire the next time the system is awake, which is guaranteed to
 * not exceed the \a L.  Note that generally \a E will be less than or equal
 * to \a L, but this is not a requirement since when the time line wraps the
 * latest expiry value may be less than the earliest even though it is
 * chronologically later; the timer task will handle this correctly.
 *
 * The function does not return a value directly, but will put a valid
 * #KiTimerId value into the passed #KiTimer structure.  This ID value can
 * be used such that when a #KiTimerExpiry signal is received, the expired timer
 * can be identified, or such that further timer functions such as #KiStopTimer
 * can be used to control the started timer.
 *
 * An alternative method of identifying timers is to use their \a userValue
 * to carry pre-defined values that can be used in switch statements and other
 * comparisons, although the #KiTimer structure is needed if the timer is to be
 * stopped at any point.
 *
 * \note On the target, the \a myTaskId field of the passed #KiTimer structure
 *        is checked to ensure that it is non-zero and also different to the
 *        special value UNKNOWN_TASK_ID.
 *
 * \param T  Pointer to the #KiTimer structure describing the timer.
 * \param E  The minimum number of #KernelTicks that must pass before the timer may
 *            expire.
 * \param L  The maximum number of #KernelTicks that may pass before the timer must

\page TechTimerOptimisation Timer Optimisation
\section Intro Introduction

This page gives information about the use of GKI timers with relation
to the power saving technique of slow clocking, whereby the main system
clock is temporarily suspended for some period to conserve battery life.

- For information about the timer API see the \ref ApiGkiTimer "GKI Timer API"
   documentation.
- For information about timer configuration switches see the
  \ref CfgGkiTimer "GKI Timer Configuration" documentation.

\section Background Background

When in idle mode, the system will normally be idle for long periods
between short bursts of activity.  For a GSM system, paging blocks will
be frequently received, and with careful selection of timer parameters,
these periods can be used to also process any timer based events such that
the system does not need to be awake at other times.

For GSM the paging rate is set by the network and is described by a
value between 2 and 9 meaning that paging blocks are to be received
that number of multi-frames apart.  A multiframe is 51 GSM frames, such
that the following gives the sleep duration in milliseconds for a
given paging rate:

\code
 gsmSleepDuration_ms = (60/13) * 51 * pagingRate
\endcode

Therefore where possible, timers should be configured such that at each paging
rate the expiry pattern can fall into the naturally occurring paging
reception blocks when the system will be awake.  If a timer cannot be made to
fit into a paging block, the timers will require the system to remain active
and may truncate or prevent sleep periods.


\section TimerStates System States

Since power saving only occurs in certain system states, it is only
timers that expire within these states that need consideration for
optimisation.  For example, the system will not have opportunity for slow
clocking while in a phone call (dedicated state), so timers that are only
used within dedicated mode can be exact or have low \a inaccuracy values.

Timers that have very long timeout periods or occur infrequently in
idle mode are also poor candidates for optimisation since they will have
little effect on power saving; for example, a timer that expires once every
10 hours will yield a very small saving over the optimisation of a timer
that expires every 10 seconds.


\section TimerConfig Timer Configuration

Timers are started using one of #KiStartWinTimer, #KiStartCoarseTimer,
#KiStartExactTimer, and #KiStartTimer.  #KiStartTimer and
#KiStartExactTimer are identical in function, and create timers that do
not allow for any optimisation with regard to power saving.

#KiStartCoarseTimer and #KiStartWinTimer are used to start a timer that
is allowed to expire within some window of values, and it is these timers
that allow for optimisation when power saving is active.  Both of these
macros call the same underlying GKI function, but allow for the window in
which the timer may expire to be expressed in different ways, each of which
may suit some applications more than others.


For #KiStartCoarsetimer, an \a inaccuracy value is expressed as a percentage
of the normal timeout period, and represents the percentage early or late in
which the timer may expire.  The following shows how the possible expiry
window is calculated:

\code
#define     KiStartCoarseTimer(T,I)                                 \
{                                                                   \
    const KernelTicks winSize = ((T)->timeoutPeriod * (I)) / 100;   \
                                                                    \
    KiStartWinTimer((T),                                            \
                    (T)->timeoutPeriod - winSize,                   \
                    (T)->timeoutPeriod + winSize,                   \
                    SIG_TIMER_EXPIRY);                              \
}
\endcode

\note If \a inaccuracy is specified as 0, the started timer will be exact,
      that is to say that calling KiStartCoarseTimer(x, 0) is the same as
      calling KiStartExactTimer(x) or even KiStartTimer(x).

#KiStartWinTimer is similar to #KiStartCoarseTimer, except that in this case
the earliest and latest timer expiry values are explicitly supplied as an
\a earliestExpiry value and a \a latestExpiry value.  It is important to note
that a timer will always be expired at some point between \a earliestExpiry
and \a latestExpiry, and if power saving is not active the \a earliestExpiry
value dictates where a timer will expire, which is important for a timer that
is used in a periodic manner.

When power saving is active, in the worst case a timer may expire after \a
latestExpiry ticks if needed, and power saving maybe prevented to ensure
that the system is awake at that #KernelTick to allow the timer to
expire.  Therefore it is important that the expiry window, either when
expressed as an \a inaccuracy or \a earliestExpiry to \a latestExpiry window
is large enough such that the expiry window covers a period in which the
system would naturally be awake.  This then prevents the timer task from
having to prevent slow clocking in case the expiry window does not cover
a situation where the system would be awake.

The implication is that for GSM systems to operate with good efficiency at
paging rate 9, the timer expiry window for timers in idle mode must be at
least 2119ms (see \ref Background section for calculation).


\section TimerOptimisation Timer Optimisation Techniques
\subsection TimerLogging Logging

A complication of attempting to detect and report timers that are
preventing power saving through slow clocking is that many of the normal
ways in which the system would normally be observed may also affect
slow clocking.  In particular the use of Genie logging or the AT command
interface will prevent or severely disrupt slow clocking, so care must
be taken when attempting to log any data.

The timer task code (in #kiostim.c) provides a number of features that can aid
in the detection of timers that prevent ideal slow clocking, but in general
these features will either #DevAssert or use \a printf to report errant
timers, and it is up to the user to use some logging mechanism that will
satisfactorily capture the data without interfering with slow clocking.

A good technique for capturing timer data is to create a RAM buffer which
can be filled with timer data, which can then be dumped or inspected
by connecting Genie or an AT interface after a profiling run has completed.
Such a mechanism is not provided by TTPCom, but can simply be implemented as
needed, allowing precise configuration to the individual needs of users.


\subsection TimerReporting Reporting Poor Timers

Defining the macro #KI_TIM_DEBUG causes the internal timer structure used by
the timer task to be extended such that it contains some information about
where the call to start the timer originated. It causes the first 7 characters
of the #MODULE_NAME, the file line and an additional unused parameter to be
stored along side the normal timer data, and although this uses a little more
memory and additionally requires additional string copying when starting a
timer, it allows for better reporting as to where in the code an errant timer
was started.

The unused parameter can be used if needed to allow timers that are
started by generic routines to be distinguished.  For example, the
following is the generic function \a L1StartTimer, used to start various
timers used within GSM Layer 1:

\code
  void L1StartTimer (L1TimerNum l1TimerNum)
  {
    L1StopTimer        (l1TimerNum);
    KiStartCoarseTimer (&l1Timer[ l1TimerNum ],
                        cfL1TimerInaccuracyPercentage[ l1TimerNum ]);
  }
\endcode

It can be seen that the MODULE_NAME and line number will not distinguish
timers started here, but that the \a l1TimerNum parameter is of interest as
it defines the timer configuration.  Altering this function and defining
#KI_TIM_DEBUG makes it simpler to distinguish which timers have been started
by this generic function, making it easier to identify exactly the timer that
maybe causing power saving issues:

\code
  void L1StartTimer (L1TimerNum l1TimerNum)
  {
    KernelTicks winSize;

    winSize = (l1Timer[ l1TimerNum ]->timeoutPeriod *
               cfL1TimerInaccuracyPercentage[ l1TimerNum ]) / 100;

    L1StopTimer   (l1TimerNum);
    KiOsStartTimer(&l1Timer[ l1TimerNum ],
                   l1Timer[ l1TimerNum ]->timeoutPeriod - winSize,
                   l1Timer[ l1TimerNum ]->timeoutPeriod + winSize,
                   MODULE_NAME,
                   __LINE__,
                   l1TimerNum);
  }
\endcode
\note Using GKI OS functions directly should only be considered for
      temporary changes used in debugging as the functions may change.
      When developing code, the defined macro interface in the form of
      the #KiStartTimer, #KiStartCoarseTimer, #KiStartWinTimer etc...
      must be used.

This technique can be used anywhere that timers are started through
generic functions where the filename and line number are not enough to
identify a timer.


\subsection TimerMaxSleep KiOsMaximumSleep

This function is called by the slow clocking sub-system before it attempts
to slow clock.  The purpose is for the timer task to indicate whether or
not the sleep period needs to be truncated to allow some timer to expire.

The macro #KI_TIM_DEBUG_POWERSAVING can be defined to cause the timer task
to print details of timers that cause the slow clocking duration to be
reduced.  When defined, the function \a KiOsMaximumSleep will call the macro
#M_KiTimErrantRpt with details of the timer that caused the greatest reduction
in slow clock duration.  When such a timer is found, it is likely that the
timer is either exact, or the expiry window is too small such that the timer
could not be postponed to the next period when the system was awake.

The default expansion of #M_KiTimErrantRpt will additionally pulse LED number
2 on and off when the full slow clock period requested by the power saving
sub-system cannot be met due to timer requirements.  This can be useful for
measuring on an oscilloscope or logic analyser.

\note By default #M_KiTimErrantRpt will expand to a simple printf(), but it
      is intended that the macro be defined to something that will collect
      and log the data in a non-intrusive manner such that slow clocking will
      not be affected by the logging itself.  This macro is only defined if
      not already defined, such that clients may implement the macro in kicfg.h
      if desired.


\subsection TimerExpiry The KiTimExpireTimer Function

This function is internal to the timer task and is called when a timer
has been determined to be ready for expiry.  When #KI_TIM_DEBUG_POWERSAVING
is defined, this function will pulse LED 0 when a coarse timer is expired
and LED 1 when an exact timer is expired, making it possible to log the
expiry pattern of timers using an oscilloscope.

The default expansion of the macro #M_KiTimErrantRpt will additionally pulse
LED 2 when a timer reduces the slow clocking duration passed into
#KiOsMaximumSleep.


\subsection TimerTrap Trapping Poorly Configured Timers

If the macro #KI_TIM_DEBUG_POWERSAVING_TRAP is defined, the system will assert
if a timer is started that fails to meet one of two requirements:

 - The window is too small, but it is not an exact timer.
   i.e. (latestExpiry - earliestExpiry) < 2119ms, but not 0.

 - The earliestExpiry is within 100ms of the present time.

This is designed to trap timers that may end up reducing power consumption by
either preventing slow clocking, or but expiring very rapidly.  In the case of
rapid timers, these may cause more work for the system, and if restarted after
each expiry, are likely to prevent slow clocking all together if their expiry
window is also small.
