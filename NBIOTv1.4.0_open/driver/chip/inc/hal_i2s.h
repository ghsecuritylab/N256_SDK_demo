 * | \b I2S             | Inter-IC Sound is a standard electrical serial bus interface used for connecting digital audio devices.
 * | \b TDM             | Time division multiplexed (TDM) formats are used when more than two channels of data are to be transferred on a single data line.|
 * | \b VFIFO \b DMA    | A virtual first in first out (VFIFO) direct memory access (DMA) device applied in an electronic device having a processor, a I2S unit and a VFIFO unit is provided. In the VFIFO DMA device, a DMA unit is for transferring data between the I2S unit and the VFIFO unit. A VFIFO controller, which has a read pointer and a write pointer, is electrically connected with the DMA unit. When the DMA unit reads data from or writes data into the VFIFO unit, the VFIFO controller correspondingly changes the value of the read pointer or the write pointer. A virtual port is electrically connected to the DMA unit and the processor. A processor reads data from or writes data into the VFIFO unit via the virtual port and the DMA unit. |
 * | \b ISR             | Interrupt service routine is a software routine that is executed in response to an interrupt.|
 * | \b NVIC            | Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller is the interrupt controller of ARM Cortex-M. For more details, please refer to <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.100166_0001_00_en/ric1417175922867.html"> NVIC introduction in ARM Cortex-M4 Processor Technical Reference Manual</a>.|

 *
 * @section HAL_I2S_Features_Chapter Supported features
 * - \b Note. \n
 *   User must configure the I2S and use this driver based on the hardware platform design. For more details about the I2S functions, please refer to platform specification document.
 *
 * - \b Master \b and \b slave \b mode. \n
 *   Based on the diversities of audio applications and hardware capabilities of external codec components, the I2S operates in different modes.
 *   In master mode, bit clock and word select lines are driven by the I2S master, while all other devices derive their internal clocks from this reference. On the contrary,
 *   bit clock and word select are derived from the external devices when slave mode is configured. Except for the clock source, the I2S in master and slave mode also provide different
 *   capabilities in sample rate, channel number and applications.
 *
 * - \b Support \b callback \b function \b registration. \n
 *   An interrupt will be triggered when the data is ready to be transferred using the I2S interface. A callback function must be registered and called to handle data transfer in the I2S interrupt service routine. \n
 *
 * @section HAL_I2S_Architecture_Chapter Software architecture of I2S
 *   - For transmit operation, call #hal_i2s_tx_write() function to transmit data.
 *      The user must query the free space in the TX buffer to ensure there is enough free space in the TX buffer for the write operation.
 *      The DMA interrupt will be triggered if the remaining data length in the TX buffer is less than the threshold.
 *      Then the DMA interrupt handler will call user's callback to notify that the TX buffer is available.
 *      User can write data to the TX buffer again by calling #hal_i2s_tx_write() function.
 *   - For receive operation, #hal_i2s_rx_read() function is used.
 *      The user must check the RX buffer and fetch data from the RX buffer until it's empty.
 *      The DMA interrupt will be triggered if the data length in the RX buffer is larger than the threshold.
 *      Then the DMA interrupt handler calls the user's callback to notify that the data is available.
 *      User can fetch the data from the RX buffer again by calling #hal_i2s_rx_read() function.
 *
 *
 * @section HAL_I2S_Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this driver
 *
 * - Configure the GPIO pins used by the I2S. \n
 *  - Set the GPIO pins for Bit clock line(BCK), word select line(WS), master clock(MCLK), data in line(DI) and data out line(DO) to support the I2S, based on the user`s hardware platform design. For more details about the PINMUX setting of the I2S functions, please refer to @ref GPIO driver document.
 *
 * - Use I2S transmit/receive (TX/RX) both on for external codec functionality. \n
 *  - Step1:   Call #hal_i2s_init() to configure the I2S type.
 *  - Step2:   Call #hal_i2s_set_config() to configure the I2S settings.
 *  - Step3:   Call #hal_i2s_set_tx_dma() and #hal_i2s_set_rx_dma() to set the memory for the I2S TX and RX DMA channel use.
 *  - Step4:   Call #hal_i2s_register_tx_callback() and #hal_i2s_register_rx_callback() to register the user-defined callback functions.
 *  - Step5:   Call #hal_i2s_enable_tx_interrupt() and #hal_i2s_enable_rx_interrupt() to enable DMA interrupt.
 *  - Step6:   Call #hal_i2s_enable_clock(),#hal_i2s_enable_tx() and #hal_i2s_enable_rx() functions to start TX and RX link data flow.
 *  - Sample code:
 *    @code

 * - Event handling for TX and RX links data transfer operations.\n
 *  - The callback functions of TX and RX links are always invoked in the NVIC ISR. It is recommended to send the events of TX and RX links to user-defined media task in callback functions and handle the corresponding data operations in media task to avoid long operations in the ISR.
 *  - An example implementation below explain how to handle events in a user-defined media task.
 *    @code
 *      static void user_i2s_tx_callback(hal_i2s_event_t event, void *user_data)
