 * This section introduces the MUX APIs in AP domain.
 *
 * Both MUX in AP domain and MUX in MD domain use CSCI Messages to provide logical communication channels to higher layer entities.
 * These channels are then used for communication between higher entities in AP domain and higher layer entities in MD domain.
 * The present document describes the MUX entity in AP domain only.
