 *
 * @section NVDM_MODEM_Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - \b Support \b retaining \b data \b after \b power \b is \b off. \n
 *   Modem NVDM stores modem data in a flash memory, so the data is preserved even after power is off. \n
 * - \b Support \b grouping \b data \b items. \n
 *   The NVDM stores data items based on group names.
 *   The user can define different data items with different group names.
 *   This enables the data item classification and keeps them in order.
 *
 * @section NVDM_MODEM_APIs_Usage_Chapter How to use the NVDM APIs
 *
 * - To use the modem NVDM services follow the steps, as shown below. \n
 *  - Step1: Call nvdm_modem_init() to initialize the NVDM module.
 *  - Step2: Call nvdm_modem_write_data_item() to write or update data item to the flash.
 *  - Step3: Call nvdm_modem_read_data_item() to read data item from the flash.
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       #define STA_IPADDR_DEFAULT_VALUE "192.168.0.1"
 *
 *       void nvdm_modem_application(void)
