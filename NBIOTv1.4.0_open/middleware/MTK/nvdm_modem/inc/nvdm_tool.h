/**
 * @brief     This function is used to write or update a data item on protected area partition of flash.
 *            If there are existing data items on the flash, the NVDM invalidates old values and replaces with new ones.
 *            No other operation is performed while the data is being written to the flash.
 *            This function returns after the data is completely written to the flash.
 *            User should check the return status to verify whether the data is written to flash successfully.
 * @param[in] group_name   is the group name of the data item, such as "Bluetooth".
 * @param[in] data_item_name   is the name of the data item, such as "address" of the "Bluetooth".
 * @param[in] type   is the data item type, which defines how the value is displayed.
 * @param[in] buffer   is the pointer to the data item's content.
 * @param[in] size   is the size of the data item's content.
 * @param[in] attr   is the attribute of WRITE operation.
 * @return
 *                #NVDM_STATUS_OK, if the operation completed successfully. \n
 *                #NVDM_STATUS_ERROR, if an unknown error occurred. \n
 *                #NVDM_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER, if the parameter is invalid. \n
 *                #NVDM_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_SPACE, if the storage space is not enough. \n
 * @note      Call this API in tasks or function callbacks, but not in the interrupt handlers.
